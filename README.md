#  Final Project Javascript

It was a interesting class. I managed to learn alot and forgotten quite a bit. But here are some notes and troubles I came across.
## &#128198; 6 weeks are up!
First of all I like to thank the classmates and Teachers who assist everyone. They were all very helpful.

I was very familiar with some of the stuff but just seemed jumbo up. My brain kept trying to process everything through a Excel VBA view.

Major issue I was seeing two methods being used. Like arrow(=>) function. It is was interesting and seemed to work just the same. 

Another issue with this project was using a function with If and for loop. I used the variable for two areas but for some reason it was counting backwards. I used Switch case instead.

Time. I wasnt able to fill comments in most of coding.
